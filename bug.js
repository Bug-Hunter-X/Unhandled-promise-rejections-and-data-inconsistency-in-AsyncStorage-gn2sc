This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and you encounter issues related to the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` library.  It often manifests as unexpected behavior, such as data not being saved or retrieved correctly, or crashes due to unhandled promises.  The root cause is frequently misusing asynchronous operations within AsyncStorage or improperly handling the `setItem` and `getItem` functions' promises. For example, forgetting to await the promise resolution in `setItem` before continuing with other code or failing to use try...catch blocks for error handling can lead to these issues.
